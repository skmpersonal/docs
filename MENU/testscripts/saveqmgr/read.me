|  Old history moved to "history" file.                              |
|  08 June 2005                                                      |
|  V6:    a. Updates for WebSphere MQ V6.0.0                         |
|         b. Removed support for MQ/WIN (aka Mayseed)                |
|         c. -o option updates.                                      |
|         d. Error messages contain source file name                 |
|         e. CURPDEPT reported for local queues if -F not specified  |
|         f. Allow SSL client connections via -C and -k flags        |
|         g. Added MCATYPE to CLUSRVCR channel types.                |
|         h. -F now also suppress ALTDATE & ALTTIME. This            |
|            should allow library systems like CVS to work ok        |
|         i. blanks between -m -r -v -a -x -k and -C flags           |
|            and specified values are option.  So both of these      |
|            work now:                                               |
|                   saveqmgr -mTEST                                  |
|                   saveqmgr -m TEST                                 |
|         j. -s now suppresses "alter qmgr" command generation       |
|                                                                    |

|  V601:  a. Fix for OpenVMS return code processing                  |
|         b. Allow putting entire DEFINE on one (or two) lines       |
|            via the -1 and -2 flags.  This makes the output         |
|            more "machine readable".                                |
|         c. Added HP executable                                     |
|         d. Fixed problem with CONVERT for zLinux qmgrs             |
|         e. Ability to specify client conn exits and data           |
|                                                                    |

|  v602:  a. Added ability to run remotely to a zOS queue manager    |
|         b. Added ability to run remotely to a iSeries queue manager|
|         c. fixed bug where lines were running > 70 chars           |
|                                                                    |

|  V603:                                                             |
|         a. -z (-Z) option to generate setmqaut commands            |
|         b. fixed small bug where rc from MQGET was being hidden    |
|            by check for MQADMIN message                            |
|         c. added options to -R (create reset commands) to allow    |
|            specifications of the TYPES of channels to reset.       |
|         d. fixed problem with 'oneLine (-1)' and chained exits.    |
|            Also trim extra space off back of chained exits.        |
|         e. iSeries didn't like qmgr names starting with numeric.   |
|         f. added additional options on the QSAVEQMGR.CMD panel.    |
|         g. If a bad CLWLUSEQ value is returned by the cmd server,  |
|            we write an error message and set the value to "QMGR"   |
|                                                                    |

|  v610a: Bugfix release - private release to only a couple of       |
|                  customers                                         |
|         a. Fix for TARGQ not showing up for v6 qmgrs (bad #ifdef)  |
|               from F.J. Brandelik                                  |

|         a. Gracefully ignore not finding objects of a given type   |
|            Mainly necessary because of zOS Qmgrs missing AUTHINFO  |
|            objects.                                                |

This SupportPac interrogates the attributes of all the objects defined to a
queue manager (either local or remote) and saves them to a file or files.  

Queue manager objects (such as queue, process, namelist, topic, etc definitions) are
saved to a file in a format suitable for use with runmqsc.  

This tool DOES NOT provide a full backup of an entire queue manager.

If the queue manager is Version 6 or greater, you can also save the OAM
definitions to a file.  The output of this file is the same as "amqoamd -s".
(This does not apply to a zOS queue manager).

It is therefore possible to use this SupportPac to save the definitions 
of objects known to a queue manager and subsequently recreate those objects on
a new queue manager.

This SupportPac can run remotely against either a zOS or a iSeries queue
manager and will generate correct MQSC for that platform.  See the section
below regarding saving zOS queue manager definitions.

All executables have been compiled against MQ v7.0.1.x.  They should run fine
against earlier versions of MQ, without needing to specify a -v switch.

The executable shipped in the "zip" file has been built on Windows/XP (saveqmgr.exe), 
with additional 64bit executables built on Windows/64-bit Vista (saveqmgr64.exe).
The executables shipped in the "tar" file have been built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.2
(saveqmgr.linux) AIX 6 (saveqmgr.aix) Solaris 10 (saveqmgr.solaris) 
and HP/UX 11 on PA-RISC (saveqmgr.hp). 
Most presupplied unix executeables are compiled for 64-bit.

(http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/index.jsp)


Installation
------------

Note: The Windows executables are only included in the ms03_win.zip file and
the Unix executables are only included in the ms03_unix.tar.Z file. The AS400
executable is included in ms03_iseries.zip.


Windows:

Copy the MS03_WIN.ZIP file to a temporary directory and uncompress using
InfoZip's Unzip.  The Windows executable is named:  "saveqmgr.exe".
On Windows, an MQ Client version of the executable is provided,
named: "saveqmgrc.exe".  The Windows 64-bit executable is named: "saveqmgr64.exe", 
with an MQ Client version named "saveqmgrc64.exe".  


Unix:

Uncompress the compressed tar file:

uncompress ms03_unix.tar.Z

Then untar the file:

tar -xvf ms03.tar

The Linux executable is named "saveqmgr.linux". 
The client version is named "saveqmgrc.linux".
These have been developed and tested under Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.2,
 and are 32-bit executables for x86 Intel processors.  The executables 

The AIX executable is named "saveqmgr.aix".  
The client version is named "saveqmgrc.aix".
These have been developed and tested under IBM AIX 6,
 and are 64-bit executables.

The Solaris executable is named "saveqmgr.solaris".  
The client version is named "saveqmgrc.solaris".
These have been developed and tested under Solaris 10,
 and are 64-bit executables.

The HP/UX executable is named "saveqmgr.hp".   
The client version is named "saveqmgrc.hp".
These have been developed and tested under HP/UX 11, 
 and are 64-bit executables.

For other platforms, you must build the executable using "make".
See the directions below.

---- Special Instructions for the AS/400 --------

Please see the included file AS400READ.ME for specifics regarding the iSeries platform.  
These files are located in ms03_iseries.zip.

---- Special Instructions for the HP NonStop Server (Tandem) --------
The makefile.hpnss will create both a OSS and a Guardian executable.  The resulting files
are named saveqmgr and saveqmgr.g for the Guardian version. 
The OSS executable runs in OSS like it does on other platforms. 
The below instructions show you how to build the OSS and Guardian executables 
(OSS steps 1 and 2) then if needed transfer and run the Guardian executable.  

On OSS:
   1. Source in the MQ environment
           cd <mqinstall>/var/mqm
           . wmqprofile
   2. Build the executables:
         make -f makefile.hpnss

   If the Guardian executable is to be used:   
       1. Change name:
               mv saveqmgr.g saveqm
       2. Copy to Guardian:
               cp saveqm /G/data01/tools/saveqmgr

      On Guardian
           1. Set the file code:
                  HP OS H06/J06:
                       FUP ALTER $DATA01.TOOLS.SAVEQMGR, CODE 800
                  HP OS G06:
                       FUP ALTER $DATA01.TOOLS.SAVEQMGR, CODE 700
           2. Load the MQ environment,
                  OBEY <$MQInstallVol.SampSubVol>.WMQCSTM
           3. Run the utility.
                 SAVEQMGR -m <qmgr> -f <output file name>
                     For example: SAVEQMGR -m TEST -f SAVETEST




Operation
---------

MS03 is a command line program and can be invoked with a -? flag to display
which parameters it will accept:

./saveqmgr.<platform> -?

where <platform> is a platform specific extension, ie .exe for windows,
.solaris for solaris, etc.

Usage is:
 --help | -h | -?  : gives help (this)
 --localQMgr | -m lqmgr : is the name of the local qmgr to connect (MQCONN)
 --remoteQmgr | -r rqmgr : is the name of the remote qmgr (XMITQ name)
 --outputFile | -f [file] : allows the output file to be named, 
    if -f is not specified, the output file defaults to SAVEQMGR.MQSC
    if -f is specified without a filename, it is named \"qmgrname\".MQSC.
 --outputFileNoHeader | -F [file] : behaves the same as -f except no header line is created in the output file
      (and CURDEPTH, ALTDATE and  ALTTIME are not reported)
 --replaceOutput | -o : specifies to replace (overwrite) the output file
    if the -o flag is not specified, then the default is to append if the file exists
    (on iSeries, *REPLACE,*APPEND must be specified after the -o flag)
 --stdout | -c : directs output to STDOUT and overrides use of -f flag
 --noSystemObjects | -s [list] : suppress creation of objects that begin with \"SYSTEM*\"
       list is a comma separated selection from 
            QMGR,QUEUE,NAMELIST,CHANNEL,PROCESS,AUTHINFO,LISTENER,SERVICE,TOPIC,SUB,NONE
       Specifying NONE is equivalent to specifying -s without any options and will override all other choices
       This is an inclusion list, System objects of the types listed *will* be reported in the output file.
 --qm : A shortcut option that is exactly equivlaent to --noSystemObjects QMGR.
       The ALTER QMGR command will be produced, all other system objects will be skipped.
 --resetChannels | -R [flags] : create RESET CHANNEL commands
    flags can be any combination of the follow to create RESET for that channel type:
    s (SENDER) v (SERVER) r (RECEIVER) q (REQUESTER) c (CLUSSDR) d (CLUSRCVR)
    the default is to create RESET commands for all the above channel types
 --permDyn | -p : Create 'local queue' definitions from PERMDYN queues.
 --ignoreErrors | -i : Ignore 'pcf' error codes 'damaged object' 'unknown object'.
    Sets RetCode to WARNING if this error encountered.
 --quiet | -q : Quiet mode, do not issue warning about unknown PCF attributes
 --oneLine | -1 : generate entire DEFINE command on one line (which does NOT include ALTDATE etc)
 --twoLines | -2 : on a 2nd line, generate the DEFINE as a comment (which DOES include ALTDATE etc)
 --saveSecurity | -z [file] : create 'security definitions (like amqoamd -s)' in file 'file'(only >=V6)
           if not specified, defaults to \"qmgrname\".AUT 
 --saveSecurityNoHeader | -Z [file]: same as -z only without the header line
 --commandServerQ | -cs [queue]: the name of the Command Server Input queue, defaults to SYSTEM.ADMIN.COMMAND.QUEUE
 --version | -v version : determines which version of MQSC to generate
      and can be '2','5','51','52','53','6', or '7'
    The default is to generate mqsc at the version of the connected queue manager
    See "Notes on the '-v' flag" in this document before using this flag. 

The Client version of this program supports these additional flags:

If either the -a or -x switch is used, then MQCONNX will be used for the client connection
 --hostname | -a host : is the address of the host for a client connection (default is "localhost")
 --channel | -x channel : is the SVRCONN name for a client connection (default is "SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN")
 --sslCipher | -C cipher spec : indicates to use an SSL cipher spec for this client connection
 --keyRepos | -k key repository : name of key respository directory if using SSL for client connection
 --channelExitX | -eX channel exit: X = 'y' for security, 's' for send, 'r' for receive
 --channelDataX | -dX channel exit data: X = 'y' for security, 's' for send, 'r' for receive.


Notes on the '-v' flag:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Normally, the "-v (version)" flag does not need to be specified.  

DO NOT USE THE -v FLAG UNLESS YOU MUST. 

This is not a change for v6.1.0, this is a more emphatic statement of existing behavior.

saveqmgr will automatically generate the correct level of MQSC based on 
the CMDLEVEL setting of the queue manager that it is connected to.  So, if it is 
connected to a v5.3 queue manager, it will generate v5.3 compatible mqsc, 
regardless of the actual level of saveqmgr itself.  The "-v" flag should only be needed 
to generate back-level MQSC.  For example, if saveqmgr is connected to a V6 queue manager 
and you want to generate v5.3 MQSC.

The delivered executables will work with ALL versions of queue managers.  However,
if you compile the package yourself on a back-level of the queue manager, that
version will not work with a more current version.  So, for example, if you
recompile the package with a V6.0 qmgr, you cannot run that executable against a
V7.0 qmgr. 

This program does NOT save other qmgr information such as is contained in qm.ini or the
Windows registry.  

Note on MQ v7 Subscription objects:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Certain parameters of MQ v7 Subscription objects are not changeable through ALTER SUB
or DEFINE SUB...REPLACE - including SELECTOR.
Saveqmgr v6.1.0 currently produces DEFINE SUB commands with REPLACE specified.  If 
you attempt to run the resulting MQSC against a queue manager that has existing Subscriptions
that you are trying to alter (including SYSTEM.* subscriptions), you will get MQSC errors.

******************************************************
The current maintainer needs your feedback on this.  
******************************************************

Various options are available, as follows:
0) Maintain existing behavior, leaving the responsibility with the MQ Admin. 
1) Produce the invalid parameters in the MQSC, but commented out like ALTDATE is.
2) Produce a pair of commands, DELETE SUB/DEFINE SUB, to remove existing objects.
3) Do not produce these parameters at all.

Other suggestions will be considered. 

"Remote" queue manager definitions can be saved in one of two ways:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Use the client version (saveqmgrc) of this SupportPac to connect to the
queue manager for which you wish to save the definitions.  You may use either
an MQSERVER variable, client channel tables or pass the connection information
as parameters to 'saveqmgrc'.

2. Connect to a local queue manager that has channel definitions to the queue
manager for which you wish to save the definitions.  In that case, you would
specify a '-m' flag naming the local queue manager and a '-r' flag naming the
remote queue manager.


Notes for Windows Users:
------------------------

WebSphere MQ V5.1 and above allows the administrator to configure
certain queue manager attributes via the Microsoft Management Console.
WebSphere MQ Version 6 and version 7 use the Eclipse based MQ Explorer.
Some of these configuration attributes are stored in the Windows Registry.
An example is "LogPrimaryFiles", which is a property of the queue manager.
Because these are not stored in MQSC format, this SupportPac does NOT back
up these types of attributes. Provision must be made for manually recording
and recovering these attrbiutes.


Local Operation
----- ---------

Start SAVEQMGR and specify command line parameters as indicated
earlier.  You must have alreaady started the queue manager and the
command server.  SAVEQMGR will, in turn, interogate the attributes
of queue manager objects. Replies will be sent to a dynamic reply queue and
processed as they are received.  Each object known to the queue
manager will have a separate entry in the resulting save file.

The messages that are sent have an expiry time of five minutes.  If
the command server is not running the request will eventually time
out and the messages will expire.  This is the most common cause of
errors.


Remote Operation
------ ---------

This is much the same as local operation.  In this case it is assumed that
you already have the WebSphere MQ network in place and that there is a default
route to the destination queue manager.  The most common way to acheive this
is to establish channels between the two queue managers the transmission
queue for which is the name of the destination queue manager or use
queue manager clustering.

Messages will expire as for local operation.  In addition to ensuring that
the command server is running at the destination queue manager it is also
necessary to ensure that the required channels are active.


Running SAVEQMGR against a zOS queue manager
------- -------- ------- - --- ----- -------

You can run 'saveqmgr' against a zOS queue manager by using either a client
connection or normal MQ routing from a local windows or unix queue manager.
In addition to returning MQSC defintions for the objects support by the
zOS queue manager, additional information is returned:

1. The CSQ6SYSP, CSQ6LOGP and CSQ6ARVP macros are reconstructed.
2. SET LOG, SET SYSTEM and SET ARCHIVE commands are created (if they have been entered on the queue manager)
3. DEFINE BUFFPOOL, DEFINE LOG, DEFINE PSID, DEFINE CFSTRUCT (if in qsg) commands are created

These definitions are commented out in the MQSC and prefixed by an indicator which
describes where these commands may run.  An example is:

*(12cr) SET SYSTEM +
*(12cr)       CTHREAD(300) +
*(12cr)       IDBACK(25) +
*(12cr)       IDFORE(105) +

In this case, this command can be issued from CSQINP1 (1), CSQINP2 (2), the zOS Console (c) and
the command server and command queue, by means of CSQUTIL, CSQINPX, or applications (r).

ZPARM macros are prefixed with '(zparm)'.


Building saveqmgr
-------- --------

Sample makefiles are included:

makefile.linux-- for building an Linux version of the executable (add -m31 for 64 bit linux on zSeries, see makefile)
makefile.aix  -- for building an AIX version of the executable.
makefile.solaris -- for building a Solaris version of the executable.
makefile.hp -- for building a HP/UX version of the executable.
makefile.windows   -- for building a Windows  version of the executable.
makefile.win64   -- for building a Windows 64-bit version of the executable.
makefile.hpnss - for building an Tandem NSK version of the executable.
makefile.compaqtru64unix - for building an Compaq Tru64 Unix version of the
                 executable (Thanks to Ralph Beckers for support)
Descrip.mms   -- for building an OpenVMS version of the executable using MMS.
Make_savqmgr.com -- for building an OpenVMS version of the executable without MMS.

makefile.os400 is no longer included in this package.  See the AS400READ.ME file in ms03_iseries.zip for details.

Edit the makefile for your platform (ie makefile.windows) and
ensure the variables point to the correct directories, etc.

On UNIX, issue: "make -f makefile.xxx", where xxx is the extension
for the platform you are compiling on.

To recompile on Windows or Win-64, issue: "nmake -f makefile.windows" or
"nmake -f makefile.win64"


Hints:
------

You can use the -c flag together with sed to customize your output file.
Suppose you want to delete all lines that contain the attribute NPMCLASS,
try running:

./saveqmgr.linux -c | sed 's/^ *NPMCLASS.*/* skipping npmclass/' > saveqmgr.tst

If you want to change all local queues to a maxdepth of 640000, try:

./saveqmgr.linux -c | sed 's/^ *MAXDEPTH.*/  MAXDEPTH(640000) +/' > saveqmgr.tst

You get the idea...

You can automate the savings of all your qmgrs on a machine with this (for linux):

dspmq | grep 'STATUS(Running)' | sed 's/QMNAME(\(.*\)) *STATUS.*/\1/' | xargs -i ./saveqmgr.linux -f {}.mqsc -m {}

With V6 of MQ, you can create a SERVICE object to automatically run saveqmgr when the qmgr itself starts:

DEFINE SERVICE ('Ms03') DESCR('Run saveqmgr when qmgr starts') STARTCMD('c:\ms03\saveqmgr.exe') +
       STARTARG('-m +QMNAME+ -f c:\temp\+QMNAME+.mqsc -o') STDOUT('c:\temp\ms03.stdout') +
       STDERR('c:\temp\ms03.stderr') CONTROL(STARTONLY) SERVTYPE(COMMAND) REPLACE

Here's a little script to delete all the queues that begin with AMQ (even the PERMDYN ones):

export QM=WBRK_QM
./saveqmgr.linux -m$QM -1 -p -c |  grep \(\'AMQ | gawk '{print "delete ql",$3}' | runmqsc $QM

A script to authorize "phred" to get from all non-SYSTEM queues:

./saveqmgr.linux -m$QM -1 -s -c | egrep '^DEFINE QLOCAL|QREMOTE|QMODEL|QALIAS' | awk '{print $3}' |  \
sed -e "s/('\(.*\)')/\1/" | xargs -i  -t setmqaut -m $QM -t q -p phred -n {} +get

If you use GNU diff with the '-F' option on saveqmgr, you can get good detail about changed objects from yesterday:

diff -c -F DEFINE /tmp/wschutz.yesterday /tmp/wschutz.today
