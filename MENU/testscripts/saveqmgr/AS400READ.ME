See the read.me file for support information and change history.

Once you have unzipped the ms03_iseries.zip file, you will notice a
file called MS03.  That is the only file AS/400 users need to work with.
Print these instructions and proceed from here.


To Save a QMGR, follow these instructions:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

On the Source AS/400, issue:
CRTSAVF FILE(QGPL/MS03)


On the Windows machine, FTP the MS03 to your AS/400 machine:
C:\SupportPac_Directory>  <change directory where the MS03 file exist>
ftp <AS/400 name>
  user:
  password:
then when logged on...
ftp> cd QGPL
ftp> bin
ftp> put MS03


Back on the AS/400, issue:
CRTSAVF (QGPL/MS03)
RSTLIB SAVLIB(MS03) DEV(*SAVF) SAVF(QGPL/MS03)
STRMQMCSVR MQMNAME(<QMGRNAME>)
MS03/QSAVEQMGR LCLQMGRNAM(<QMGRNAME>) FILENAME('MS03/QMQSC(<QMGRNAME>)')

By default, this command will either create the file 'MS03/QMQSC(<QMGRNAME>)',
or append the output to file 'MS03/QMQSC(<QMGRNAME>)' if it already exists,
and will include objects whose names commence with 'SYSTEM.'
Prompting the MS03/QSAVEQMGR command with PF4, will reveal additional optional
parameters for VERSION, RMTQMGRNAM, RDEFSYS and OUTPUT.

VERSION : determines which version of MQSC to generate
      and can be '520','530', '600'or '700'
    Note: '520', '530', '600', '700' are only available if the program has been
      compiled with the correct level of the queue manager.

LCLQMGRNAM: is the name of the local qmgr 
	(the one we MQCONN to)

RMTQMGRNAM: is the name of a remote qmgr 
	(this should match an XMITQ name on the local qmgr)

FILENAME: the name of the file to write the MQSC ouput into.
	defaults to '*CURLIB/QMQSC(SAVEQMGR)'

RDEFSYS: controls creation of objects that begin with "SYSTEM*".
     *YES means objects whose name starts with SYSTEM are created.

OUTPUT:  specifies to replace (overwrite) the output file
    	*REPLACE replaces (overwrites) the output file
	*APPEND appends to an output file if it already exists.

MAKEAUTH: Whether or not to make GRTMQMAUT commands into a CL source file.

AUTHFN:  The name of the file to create GRTMQMAUT commands.
	defaults to '*CURLIB/QMAUT(SAVEQMGR)'

PERMDYN:  Whether or not to make "define qlocal" commands for PERMDYN queues.

IGNDAMAGED: Normally, a report from the command server of a "damanged object"
	causes saveqmgr to stop.  Setting this to *YES causes it to continue.


To Restore the saved QMGR using the MS03 SupportPac, follow these instructions:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The first step is to properly quiesce and delete the QMGR you are about to restore,
if it still exists.  Then, follow the four steps below to restore the Queue Manager
from source file MS03/QMQSC(<QMGRNAME>) previously created by the QSAVEQMGR program...

STRSBS SBSD(QMQM)
CRTMQM MQMNAME(<QMGRNAME>)
STRMQM MQMNAME(<QMGRNAME>)
STRMQMMQSC SRCMBR(<QMGRNAME>) SRCFILE(MS03/QMQSC) MQMNAME(<QMGRNAME>)


If you have saved the object authorities (MAKEAUTH(*YES)), then you can restore
those permissions:

CRTCLPGM PGM(MS03/QMAUT) SRCFILE(MS03/QMAUT) SRCMBR(SAVEQMGR) REPLACE(*YES)
CALL MS03/QMAUT


You should now have a restored copy of Queue Manager <QMGRNAME>.





*OPTIONAL INSTRUCTIONS
- - - - - - - - - - -


To Restore a saved QMGR using the MS03 SupportPac to a Target AS/400 with WebSphere MQ,
follow these instructions (OPTIONAL):
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

To restore the QMGR to another system, save the source file 'MS03/QMQSC(<QMGRNAME>)'
into a savefile, and FTP in binary mode into a savefile on the target AS/400 system.
The following are instructions for each side:

On Target AS/400 System:
CRTSAVF FILE(QGPL/<QMGRNAME>)


On Source AS/400 System:
CRTSAVF FILE(QGPL/<QMGRNAME>)
SAVOBJ OBJ(QMQSC) LIB(MS03) DEV(*SAVF) SAVF(QGPL/<QMGRNAME>)
FTP <Target AS/400 name>
  user:
  password:
then when logged on...
ftp> cd QGPL
ftp> lcd QGPL
ftp> bin
ftp> put <QMGRNAME>.savf


Back on the Target AS/400 System:
CRTLIB LIB(<QMGRNAME>)
RSTOBJ OBJ(*ALL) SAVLIB(MS03) DEV(*SAVF) SAVF(QGPL/<QMGRNAME>) RSTLIB(<QMGRNAME>)
STRSBS SBSD(QMQM)
CRTMQM MQMNAME(<QMGRNAME>)
STRMQM MQMNAME(<QMGRNAME>)
STRMQMMQSC SRCMBR(<QMGRNAME>) SRCFILE(<QMGRNAME>/QMQSC) MQMNAME(<QMGRNAME>)



You should now have a restored copy of the Source QMGR on your Target AS/400.



Recompile Instructions (OPTIONAL):
- - - - - - - - - - - -


For the AS400 platform, the required programs are already compiled in the original MS03 SAVF file.
However, in the event you need/want to recreate the programs for the MS03 SupportPac
you can follow the instructions below.

On the AS/400, issue (example syntax allows for debug and assumes the source files have
already been restored to the MS03 Library and you have a license for the
'C' compiler):

CRTCLPGM PGM(MS03/BUILDMS03) SRCFILE(MS03/QCLSRC) SRCMBR(BUILDMS03) REPLACE(*YES)
CALL MS03/BUILDMS03
